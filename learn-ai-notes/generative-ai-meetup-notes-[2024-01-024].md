# Generative AI Expert Talk Notes [2024-01-024]

+ Natural language processing
  + O'Reilly book: Practical NLP

# Key Developments in Generative AI Related to NLP
+ NLP: working with & processing human languages, understanding them, then performing various tasks with them
  + E.g., chatbots, voice assistants
  + Categorization via text extraction
+ Using AI to create something new, an AI that can perform a task by itself, usually as a response to a human prompt
+ Open source language models
+ Small large language models
+ What made ChatGPT possible was reinforcement learning: learning with/from human feedback
+ Can lead to more natural sounding output
+ Research on results of human vs. AI feedback
+ Direct optimization
+ How to deploy these models, e.g., in a GPU environment with certain constraints
+ How are you training these models & what kind of data are you using?
+ Quantum computing can help generative AI handle massive computing
+ How can AI help quantum computing? -> find new formulae to understand quantum computing (?)
+ Content summarization & data storage
+ Not guaranteed that one provider will always do well/be optimal for a situation
  + Weigh different needs such as speed & privacy
+ Vector databases, OpenSearch
+ Is size/amount of data consumed related to getting better responses?
  + My thoughts: intersection of quality & quantity because need accurate input for accurate output
  + AI hallucination
  + Different tasks
  + Accuracy

# Market Trends & Recent Applications
+ LLM & generative models can hallucinate & produce inaccurate results
+ Problematic automatic data labeling
+ Manual labeling is expensive
+ Programmatic data labeling & programmatic learning data labeling
+ Combining different language models
+ Personalizing feedback for different users/learners
+ Multilingual models require multiple input & output models, maybe common threads to connect them?

# Research & Industry Challenges & Opportunities

+ General Trends & Challenges in using LLM in practice
+ How do you validate the robustness of LLMs? How do you make them stronger/less harmful/less toxic/better at following direction?
+ Security 
  + Role of blockchain for training tracability (https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/22/blockchain-tech-behind-bitcoin-can-be-used-to-track-ai-training-data.html)

# How To Get Ready To Join The Market?
+ Different than regular software engineering because focused on different problems
+ Prompt engineering & training
+ Job market is trending more towards that than web/full stack
+ Skills needed:
  + Software engineering
    + Languages: Python, Rust
    + Machine learning
    + Environments & containerization
    + Can develop AI in Python, then leverage API to serve data to other languages & applications for usage
    + Using AI for developing & programming (especially in other languages like Javascript)
  + Domain knowledge
  + Problem solving
  + Prompt engineering
  + Current events & developments in both research & practice
  + Line between research & practice is starting to get blurred in LLM
+ Applications
  + Accessibility
  + Healthcare
  + Privacy
