+ "The four steps to writing a quantum program are

    1. Map the problem to a quantum-native format
    2. Optimize the circuits and operators
    3. Execute using a quantum primitive function
    4. Analyze the results"
  - From https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/hello-world

## Learning Roadmap
+ Steps to learn to write a quantum program & run a quantum computation job: 
    1. Learn how to use IBM's Quantum Computing Platform.
    2. Learn how to use IBM's Qiskit toolkit.
    3. Learn quantum information basics.
    4. Learn Python since Qiskit requires Python knowledge.
