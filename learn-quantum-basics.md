# Learn Quantum Basics

## Quantum Mechanics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics
+ "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of nature at and below the scale of atoms."
  + Nature = light-matter-[sound!]
  + Nature (gift)
+ Quantum mechanics is how light-matter-[sound?] acts or below the scale of atoms
+ Quantum dimensionality: quantum dimension created by coordinates of space-time-?
+ TODO: continue to look into measurements in multiple dimensions
  + Einstein, mass, 5th dimension
  + Mass as a measurement of matter & light? movement?
  + https://www.scirp.org/html/7-4500182_36512.htm#:~:text=We%2C%20along%20with%20space%20and,simple%20cases%2C%20and%20obtained%20solutions
  + If a star is flat, is it in 1 dimension?
  + Klauza-Klein theory


## Noise & Errors
  + Noise Modeling of the IBM Quantum Experience: 
    + Publication: https://research.ibm.com/publications/noise-modeling-of-the-ibm-quantum-experience
    + Presentation: https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/D72.9
  + Mathematical formulae describing fluctuation takes parameters as functions of time
  + What if they took them as functions of space-time-sound
  + Noise is error but there is a type of sound that indicates things are running smoothly, so aim for that
  + Sound of things running smoothly follows certain musical patterns & tendencies 
  + Resources are a parameter for the function determining if things are running smoothly; error noise is what happens when things are not running smoothly (just as programming functions can throw errors &/or warnings that make noise & can distract)
  + ASCII 7& /?, keep key mapping levels
  + Order matters, rearrange order of operations if current order is not working
  + Ripples, do noises amplify over time?

## "Noise Modeling of the IBM Quantum Experience*"
https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/D72.9
    + TODO
## "Precision gate characterization in the presence of low-frequency noise on a superconducting processor"
https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/D72.3
  + How to determine which gate you are at
  + Precision quantum estimation relies on "coherent amplification"
  + Flux noise makes low frequencies; low noises; makes things move slow -> leads to errors
  + Figure out how to move super fast -> requires high frequencies, high noises (levels)
## "Two Qubit Correlated Noise and Crosstalk Characterization"
https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/D72.5
  + "Spatiotemporally correlated noise and crosstalk have a negative impact on error correcting schemes."
  + Use quantum geometry since there are 3 coordinates space-time-?
  + "Single-qubit & joint two-qubit measurements" - what about tiple-qubits? or joint triple qubits (2^3 = 8)?
  + Quantum geometry & measurement: 2 measurements in 3 dimensions
    + 2 measurements, taken in 3 different dimensions
    + Dimension is a measurement
    + Diminsional planes are coordinated measurements of space-time-?
  + Ties into Python versioning
  + Multiplication vs. exponentation
  + Ellipses instead of circles, similar to astronomy
  + Quantum Decoherence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence
    + How quantum mechanics behave differently when scaled too large


# The Bigger & Smaller Pictures
# 3 Levels of Mechanics (behavior of nature in space-time-?)  
+ Quantum Mechanics (too small to see) -> Classical Mechanics (visible) -> Relativistic Mechanics (too big to see)

# Relativistic Mechanics
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_mechanics
+ Relativistic Mechanics involves objects moving at a speed so fast it is relative to the speed of light, represented as a variable `c`.
